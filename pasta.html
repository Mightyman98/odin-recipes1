    <h2>Homade Pasta</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> All-purpose flour – In the past, I thought you needed 00 flour or semolina flour to make great fresh pasta, but this homemade pasta recipe proved me wrong. In it, regular all-purpose flour yields chewy, bouncy noodles every time. </li>
        <li>Eggs – The key ingredient for adding richness and moisture to the dough!</li>
        <li>Olive oil – Along with the eggs, a splash of olive oil moistens the dough </li>
        <li>Salt – Add it to the dough and the pasta water for the best flavor.</li>
    </ol>
